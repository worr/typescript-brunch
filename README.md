# typescript-brunch [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/brunch/typescript-brunch.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/brunch/typescript-brunch)

Adds TypeScript support to [Brunch](http://brunch.io).

## Usage

Install the plugin and TypeScript via NPM with `npm install --save-dev typescript-brunch typescript`.

Or, do manual install:

* Add `"typescript-brunch": "x.y"` to `package.json` of your brunch app. Pick a plugin version that corresponds to your major.minor (x.y) Brunch version. You still need to install TypeScript manually `npm install --save-dev typescript`.
* If you want to use git version of plugin, add
`"typescript-brunch": "github:brunch/typescript-brunch"`.

## brunch-config

If there is a `tsconfig.json` file present in the root of your project, the `compilerOptions` from that will be used as defaults.

Any options in your `brunch-config.js` or `brunch-config.coffee` will override those.

```js
module.exports = {
  // ...
  plugins: {
    typescript: {
      removeComments: true
    }
  }
};
```

If no options are provided, this plugin will default to the following:

```js
{
  target: "es5",
  module: "commonjs",
  emitDecoratorMetadata: true,
  experimentalDecorators: true,
}
```

## Errors

From version 1.8.2 up to current version, this plugin may report TypeScript errors that you are not expecting. This is due to the fact that this plugin compiles each file separately in isolation, and doesn't take advantage of the full TypeScript project. As such there are some errors which may appear which are false positives.

Starting in 1.8.3 you could add an `ignoreErrors` property the plugin config object in the `brunch-config` file. This was an array of error numbers to ignore. Starting in 2.0.1, you can ignore all TypeScript errors by setting `ignoreErrors` to `true` (this was broken in 2.0.0). Setting it to an array still works as before.

We are hoping to support the full language service, at least for `brunch build` at some point, but until then, we recommend that you add `tsc --noEmit` to your test script or build script to catch proper errors within your project.

Just to note that this shouldn't affect any TypeScript support your editor/IDE provides, which should also allow you to identify real errors.
